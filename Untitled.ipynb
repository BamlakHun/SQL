    "# ## What is a Database and DBMS?\n",
    "# A **database** is an organized collection of structured or unstructured data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.\n",
    "# A **Database Management System (DBMS)** is a collection of programs that allow you to create, manage, and operate a database. It serves as an interface between the database and its end users or programs, allowing users to retrieve, update, and manage how the information is organized and optimized.\n",
    "# ---\n",
    "# ## What is SQL?\n",
    "# **SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a programming language for storing and processing information in a database.\n",
    "# ---\n",
    "# ## How SQL is Different from Other Programming Languages like Python?\n",
    "# 1. **SQL** is optimized to work with databases. It is very fast in performing operations like retrieving, inserting, updating, and deleting data.\n",
    "# 2. **Python**, on the other hand, is a general-purpose programming language. It can be used for a wide range of tasks, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, automation, and more. It is not optimized specifically to work with databases.\n",
    "# ---\n",
    "# ### Key Difference:\n",
    "# - **SQL** is much simpler to understand and work with for database-related operations.\n",
    "# - **Python** is used to execute SQL code and integrate database operations with other tasks (e.g., web scraping, automation, etc.)."

    "# Databases and Tables\n",
    "# \n",
    "# * A DBMS (Database Management System) can have many databases. For example:\n",
    "#   - `marketplace` database\n",
    "#   - `payments` database\n",
    "# \n",
    "# * A database can have multiple tables. For instance, the `marketplace` database might contain tables such as:\n",
    "#   - `orders`\n",
    "#   - `customers`\n",
    "#   - `products`\n",
    "# \n",
    "# **Table Structure**:\n",
    "# * A table is where the actual data is stored.\n",
    "# * Most SQL queries are run directly on tables.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# ## Table Creation and Schema\n",
    "# \n",
    "# When creating a table, you need to:\n",
    "# 1. Specify the table name\n",
    "# 2. Define column names\n",
    "# 3. Declare data types for each column\n",
    "# \n",
    "# The collection of column names and their data types is called the **schema** of a table.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# ### Example Schema\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Consider a `users` table with the following columns:\n",
    "# - `id`\n",
    "# - `name`\n",
    "# - `email`\n",
    "# - `country`\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Much like how Python has data types like `int` and `string`, SQL also has specific data types for defining the kind of data each column will store."
